Usage: stunserver [OPTION]...
Start a STUN server in one of various modes of operation using any of
the [OPTION]s described below:

Available options:
  --mode=MODE
     Where MODE is either "basic" or "full".  In basic mode, the server only listens on one port and does not support STUN CHANGE requests. In full mode, the STUN service listens on two different interfaces and two different ports on each.  A client binding request may specify an option for the server to send the response back from one of the alternate interfaces and/or ports.  Basic mode is sufficient for basic NAT traversal.  Full mode facilitates clients attempting to determine NAT behavior and NAT filtering behavior.  Full mode requires two unique network interfaces with different IP addresses. Full mode does not work with TCP or TLS, only UDP.  If this parameter is not specified, basic mode is the default.

  --primaryinterface=INTERFACE or IPADDRESS
     The value for this option may the name of an interface (such as "eth0" or "lo").  Or it may be one of the available IP addresses assigned to a network interface present on the host (such as "128.23.45.67"). The interface chosen will be used by the service as the primary listening address in either full or basic mode.  In basic mode, the default primary interface is ALL adapters (socket binds to INADDR_ANY). In full mode, the service binds to the the first non-localhost interface that in the UP state with a valid IP Address.

  --altinterface=INTERFACE OR IPADDRESS
     Same as the --primaryinterface option, except this option's value specifies the listening address for the alternate address in full mode. It has no meaning in basic mode nor does it have meaning in when TCP or TLS is the listening protocol. In full mode, the service will bind to the the second non-localhost interface that is in the UP state with a valid IP address.

  --primaryport=PORTNUM
     PORTNUM is a value between 1 to 65535.  This is the UDP or TCP port that the primary and alternate interfaces listen on as the primary port for binding requests.  The default is 3478 for UDP and TCP.  For TLS it is 5349.

  --altport=PORTNUM
     PORTNUM is a value between 1 to 65535.  This is the UDP or TCP port that the primary and alternate interfaces listen on as the alternate port. The default is 3479.  It has no meaning in FULL mode.

  --family=IPVERSION
     IPVERSION is either "4" or "6" to specify the usage of IPV4 or IPV6. If not specified, the default value is "4".

   --protocol=PROTO
     PROTO is either "udp", "tcp", or "tls".  Where "udp" is the default.  "tcp" and "tls" modes are only available when the --mode option is "basic".  (Note: tcp and tls are not yet available in this version)

   --verbosity=LOGLEVEL
     Sets the verbosity of the logging level.  0 is the default (minimal output and logging).  1 shows slightly more.  2 and higher shows even more.

   --help
     Prints this help page

Examples:
stunserver
    With no options, starts a basic STUN binding service on UDP port 3478.

stunserver --mode full --primaryinterface 128.34.56.78 --altinterface 128.34.56.79
  Above example starts a dual-host STUN service on the the interfaces identified by the IP address "128.34.56.78" and "128.34.56.79".  There are four socket listeners:
      128.34.56.78:3478 (Primary IP, Primary Port)
      128.34.56.78:3479 (Primary IP, Alternate Port)
      128.34.56.79:3478 (Primary IP, Primary Port)
      128.34.56.79:3479 (Alternate IP, Alternate Port)

  An error occurs if the addresses specified do not exist on the local host running the service.

stunserver --mode=full --primaryinterface=eth0 --altinterface=eth1
  Same as above, except the interfaces are specified by their names as enumerated by the system.  (The "ifconfig" or "ipconfig" command will enumerate available interface names.
